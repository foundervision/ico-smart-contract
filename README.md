# Vision Coin Token Smart Contract

This project contains the code for the smart contract of the VisionCoin (VC) token including the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) functionality.

## Introduction

`By taking part in the Foundervision ICO, you comply with the rules set up in the smart contract.`

That sounds reasonable, but it's easier said than done, because only a small fraction of potential ICO participants are able to read Smart Contracts. 

While the rules of the VisionCoin ICO are already lined out in the Whitepaper, this resource will present you a more comprehensive description of the inner workings of the ICO Smart Contract. 

Transparency is a key value at Foundervision and to build up trust we opened our ICO Smart Contract functionality for everyone else to see. Be assured that this is the beginning of a future standard for all of our work with the Blockchain: nothing will be hidden or obfuscated. It can't work otherwise. Transparency is the key.

In the following documentation we will use `VC` when we reference to the tokens (`V`ision`C`oin) and `SC` when we reference a Smart Contract (`S`mart `C`ontract).

All the contracts functionality is tested and the test cases can be seen at the end of this document and, if you are interested in the testing sources, in the `/test` folder.

### Deployment key facts

At the time the `SC` is deployed to the network it will generate 200.000.000 Tokens with the name `VisionCoin`, the Symbol `VC` and a maximum of `18` decimals (reflecting `ether`'s smallest unit â€“ `wei`). 

200.000.000 is the fixed supply, there will never be more `VC` in circulation.

After the `VC`s are created, the total supply will be split in half.

 - `100.000.000 VC` will go to a special ICO wallet which will be used to serve `VC` during the ICO.
 - `100.000.000 VC` will go to a wallet owned by Foundervision. These 100.000.000 `VC`s will be splitted into different wallets again to deversify and lower the risk of being hacked as a whole, but that's not part of the `SC`.

During deployment, the `SC` will setup a date range in which the Pre-ICO and the ICO will take place. It does not necessarily mean that the token sale will start or end at exactly these dates. It's just a boundary that will limit the ICO duration.

A defined amount of the 100.000.000 ICO `VC`s will be handed out as a present to people that show interest in the Coin via http://www.foundervision.com and register themselves together with their wallet address. This special offer will be available until the end of the ICO. Each registration on the homepage will lead to a 10 `VC` present until the 250.000 `VC` pot is empty. 

The Pre-ICO is restricted to a maximum supply of `50.000.000 VC`. If this supply is exceeded with a transaction while the Pre-ICO is running, the transaction will be rejected.

### Vision Coins

The VisionCoin implements the ERC20 Token Standard officially published by ethereum and described here: https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard

To adhere with the ERC20 specification, we are deriving our `SC` from the audited Open-Zeppelin Standard Token implementation: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/StandardToken.sol

### Exchange rate

We defined a fixed exchange ratio of 1000/1, which means that with each `Ether` that you send to the ICO you'll get (at least, see bonus system) 1000 `VC` back. This ratio will not change throughout the ICO, independent of the Ether value.

### Minimum transaction

In the Pre-ICO phase, the minimum transaction is of variable Ether, you can see the minimum rates at http://www.foundervision.com 

In the ICO Phase a minimum of 0,01 Ether (10 `VC`) is set. Transaction below these limits will be rejected.

### Stages

The `SC` holds a variable to identify the stage of the contract. This stage can be one of the following values:

- **NONE** Initial stage, development.
- **DEPLOYED** The contract was deployed to the blockchain.
- **PRE_ICO_RUNNING** The Pre-ICO is running.
- **PRE_ICO_PAUSED** The Pre-ICO is paused.
- **PRE_ICO_FINISHED** The Pre-ICO is finished.
- **ICO_RUNNING** The ICO is running.
- **ICO_PAUSED** The ICO is paused.
- **ICO_FINISHED** The ICO is finished.
- **ACTIVE** The Pre-ICO and the ICO are finished. The Vision Coin is active, no ICO possible anymore.

The ICO is split into two main stages. 

In the Pre-ICO stage you'll get an `additional 20 %` on top, but to participate in the Pre-ICO, a minimum deposit of `XX Ether` is required. 

In the ICO phase there is a lower limit of 0,01 Ether to participate and the bonus table is the same as in the Pre-ICO phase. The bonus table applies to both phases.

The 2 phases are identified through the contracts stage, namely `PRE_ICO_RUNNING` and `ICO_RUNNING`.

### Bonus system

The ICO is working with a bonus system. So depending on the amount of ether you will send to the contract, you will get additional `VC`. Here is the bonus table:

| Min Ether    | Bonus Percent | Bonus VC Outcome  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| +1.000 ether | 10.00 %       | +100.000,00 VC    |
| +750 ether   | 9.00 %        | +60.750,00 VC     |
| +500 ether   | 8.00 %        | +40.000,00 VC     |
| +250 ether   | 7.00 %        | +10.750,00 VC     |
| +100 ether   | 6.00 %        | +6000,00 VC       |
| +75 ether    | 5.00 %        | +3750,00 VC       |
| +50 ether    | 4.00 %        | +2000,00 VC       |
| +25 ether    | 3.00 %        | +750,00 VC        |
| +20 ether    | 2.75 %        | +550,00 VC        |
| +10 ether    | 2.50 %        | +250,00 VC        |
| +5 ether     | 2.00 %        | +100,00 VC        |
| +4 ether     | 1.50 %        | +60,00 VC         |
| +3 ether     | 1.00 %        | +30,00 VC         |
| +2 ether     | 0.75 %        | +15,00 VC         |
| +1 ether     | 0.50 %        | +5,00 VC          |
| less         | 0.00 %        | +0 VC             |

### Stage Control

As said before, the `SC` holds a stage. It can switch between different stages. The stage changes can only be executed by the `SC` owner, which is Foundervision, but there are also some other rules that must apply for a successful stage change.

The following list shows the allowed stage transitions.

| From | To   |
| ---- | ---- |
| NONE | DEPLOYED |
| DEPLOYED | PRE_ICO_RUNNING |
| PRE_ICO_RUNNING | PRE_ICO_PAUSED |
| PRE_ICO_PAUSED | PRE_ICO_RUNNING |
| PRE_ICO_PAUSED | PRE_ICO_FINISHED |
| PRE_ICO_RUNNING | PRE_ICO_FINISHED |
| PRE_ICO_FINISHED | ICO_RUNNING |
| ICO_RUNNING | ICO_PAUSED |
| ICO_PAUSED | ICO_RUNNING |
| ICO_PAUSED | ICO_FINISHED |
| ICO_RUNNING | ICO_FINISHED |
| ICO_FINISHED | ACTIVE |

There are more underlying rules for the transitions, but this table shows 
the possible flow control at a whole.

#### Starting the Pre-ICO

The function that switches to the stage `PRE_ICO_RUNNING` and starts the Pre-ICO phase is called `startPreICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `DEPLOYED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.
 - The current timestamp is greater than or equal the start date of the Pre-ICO.
 - The current timestamp is lower than the end date of the ICO. 

The last two parts are important. The start and end-date from the deployment are just an additional security measurement. 

Just because the Pre-ICO start date is set, it does not necessarily mean, that the Pre-ICO starts at that date. The owner of the contract has to call the startPreICO()` method to actually change the stage and start the Pre-ICO phase.

This can become handy if there are problems with the contract itself and the start of the Pre-ICO has to be delayed.

#### Pausing the Pre-ICO

The function that switches to the stage `PRE_ICO_PAUSED` and pauses the Pre-ICO phase is called `pausePreICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `PRE_ICO_RUNNING`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

This can become handy if there are problems with the contract itself and we want to protect investors.

#### Resume the Pre-ICO

The function that switches to the stage `PRE_ICO_RUNNING` and resumes the previously paused Pre-ICO is called `resumePreICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `PRE_ICO_PAUSED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

#### Finish the Pre-ICO

The function that finishes the Pre-ICO is called `finishPreICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `PRE_ICO_RUNNING` OR `PRE_ICO_PAUSED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.
 
#### Start the ICO

The function that starts the ICO is called `startICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `PRE_ICO_FINISHED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

#### Pausing the ICO

The function that switches to the stage `ICO_PAUSED` and pauses the ICO phase is called `pauseICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `ICO_RUNNING`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

#### Resume the ICO

The function that switches to the stage `ICO_RUNNING` and resumes the previously paused ICO is called `resumeICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `ICO_PAUSED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

#### Finish the ICO

The function that finishes the ICO is called `finishICO()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `ICO_RUNNING` OR `ICO_PAUSED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.
 
#### Set Active

The function that sets the contracts stage to ACTIVE is called `setActive()`.

The following rules must apply for a successful stage change:

 - The current stage is `ICO_FINISHED`.
 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.

### Gifts

There is a function that is used to gift a given address with 10 VC from the ICO wallet. 

The following rules must apply for a successful gift:

 - The caller of the function is the owner of the contract.
 - The amount of giftable VCs is greater or equal 10 (initial 250.000).
 - The address was not gifted before.

## Development

The code is developed with the help of the open-zeppelin project as an audited 
base for secure contracts as well as the truffle framework to test the smart
contracts functionalities.

 - [open-zeppeling](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity)
 - [truffle framework](http://truffleframework.com/)

You can either use the development environment (docker) provided with source
in the `.docker` directory and exposed via Makefile.

Or you can install all dependencies by yourself.
